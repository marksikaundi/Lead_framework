# Overview

This repository contains information about the lead poisoning crisis in Kabwe, Zambia. The city is heavily contaminated with lead due to the legacy of a large-scale lead and zinc mine that operated for over 90 years without adequate environmental safeguards.

## Problem Statement

The uncontrolled release of lead into the environment has resulted in widespread lead poisoning among the population, particularly children. High levels of lead in children's blood have been linked to severe health issues, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.

## Data and Resources

Data:
Blood lead levels in children and adults
Soil and water contamination levels
Epidemiological data on health impacts
Demographic data on the affected population

## Resources:

Academic papers and research articles
Reports from NGOs and government agencies
Media coverage of the crisis
Images and videos documenting the situation
Potential Projects and Research
